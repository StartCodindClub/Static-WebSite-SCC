                         certificates are a popular option, likely because they take significantly
                         less time to complete than degrees.This guide explores the best online

                         and career advantages of online certificate programs.</p><br>
                        <p>There are currently three types of higher education accreditation
                         in the United States. Regional accreditation focuses on 
                         degree-oriented nonprofit institutions, which may be public
                         or private schools. For-profit trade or sectarian schools
                         often seek national accreditation. The third type, 
                         programmatic accreditation, focuses on specific programs
                         offered by schools that hold national or regional accreditation.
                         The U.S. Department of Education (ED) and the Council for 
                         Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) oversee the accrediting
                         process and make sure accrediting agencies apply the same
                         rigorous standards to all the schools and programs that
                         fall under their rightful jurisdiction.
                         Accreditation signifies more than quality education.
                         Students can only receive federal financial assista  
                         if they are enrolled in an accredited institution. 
                         Accreditation also matters when transferring credits.
                         Schools with regional accreditation only accept credits earned
                         at another institution that holds the same type of accreditation.
                         They seldom accept credits earned at a school with national
                         accreditation.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>In evaluating online programs, consider those offered by an
                         accredited school. If you are looking for an online school 
                         (and not just a brick-and-mortar campus offering online programs),
                         look for accreditation by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission
                         (DEAC). ED and CHEA recognize DEAC as the main accreditor for online
                         schools.</p>
